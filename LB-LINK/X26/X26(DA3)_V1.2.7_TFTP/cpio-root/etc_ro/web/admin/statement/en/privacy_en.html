provide certain information by which you can be identified when using 
B-link products and services, it will only be used in accordance with 
this Privacy Policy and/or our terms and conditions for users. <br>

your local data protection legislation. We are equally committed to 
ensuring that all our employees and agents uphold these obligations. <br>
Ultimately, what we want is the best for all our users. Should you have 
any concerns with our data handling practice as summarised in this 
Privacy Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer at

Program, allow B-link to analyse data about how users use the mobile 
phone and B-link services, so as to improve the user experience, such as
 sending crash reports. <br>

definition lists) is used for virus scan functions. <br>
Push Service. B-link Account ID and IMEI numbers will also be used to 
provide the B-link push service to evaluate advertising performance and

announcements, including information about sales and promotion. You may 
opt out of receiving push notifications from each of the apps at any 
time through changing your preferences under "Settings". <br>
Verification. B-link uses the ECV value to verify the user identity and 
ensure there is no log-in by hackers or unauthorised persons. <br>

B-link make improvements to our services. In order to follow up on the 
feedback you have chosen to provide, B-link may correspond with you

 important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes

We may use your name, phone number, and email address, B-link Account ID
 and IMEI number to provide marketing materials to you relating to goods

B-link shares your personal information with a Third Party Service

contractually specify that the third party is subject to practices and 
obligations to comply with applicable local data protection laws. B-link
 will contractually ensure compliance by any Third Party Service 
Providers with the privacy standards that apply to them in your home 
jurisdiction. <br>
Sharing with our Group and Third Party Service Providers <br>
From time to time, in order to conduct business operations smoothly in 
providing you with the full capabilities of our products and services, 
we may disclose your personal information from time to time to other 
B-link affiliated companies (in communications, social media, technology
 or cloud businesses), or our third party service providers which are 
our mailing houses, delivery service providers, telecommunications 
companies, data centres, data storage facilities, customer service 
providers, advertising and marketing service providers, agents acting on
 behalf of B-link, related corporations, and/or other third parties 
(together "Third Party Service Providers"). Such Third Party Service 
Providers would be processing your personal information on B-link's 
behalf or for one or more of the purposes listed above. <br>
Sharing with our Group's ecosystem companies <br>
  <br>
B-link works together with a cool group of companies, which together 
form the B-link Ecosystem. The B-link Ecosystem companies are 
independent entities, invested and incubated by B-link, and are experts 
in their fields. B-link may disclose your personal data to the B-link 
Ecosystem companies so as to provide you with and improve the exciting 
products and services (both hardware and software) from the B-link 
Ecosystem companies. Some of these products and services will still be 
under the B-link brand, while others may use their own brand. The B-link
 Ecosystem companies may also share data with B-link from time to time 
in relation to products and services under the B-link brand to provide 
hardware and software services, and to create better functions and user 
experience. If B-link is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale

Sharing with Others <br>
B-link may disclose your personal information without further consent when required under applicable law. <br>

on our website, we may share them trends about the general use of our 
services, such as the number of customers in certain demographic groups 
who purchased certain products or who carried out certain transactions. <br>
For the avoidance of doubt, B-link may collect, use or disclose your 
personal information without your consent if it is and only to the 
extent it is allowed explicitly under local data protection laws, such 
as to comply with a subpoena, and when we believe in good faith that 
disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or 
the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government 
request. <br>
Security Safeguards <br>
  <br>
B-link's Security Measures <br>
We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. 
In order to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure or other similar 
risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and 
managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
 on your mobile device and on B-link websites. We will use all 
reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information. <br>
For example, when you access your B-link Account, you can choose to use 
our two-step verification process for better security. When you send or 
receive data from your B-link device to our servers, we make sure they 
are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") and other algorithms. <br>
All your personal information is stored on secure servers that are 
protected in controlled facilities. We classify your data based on 
importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information 
has the highest security level. We make sure that our employees and 
Third Party Service Providers who access the information to help provide
 you with our products and services are subject to strict contractual 
confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
 fail to meet such obligations. We have special access controls for 
cloud based data storage as well. All in all, we regularly review our 
information collection, storage and processing practices, including 
physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorised access and
 use. <br>
We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal 
information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet 
is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the 
security or integrity of any personal information which is transferred 
from you or to you via the Internet. <br>
What you can do! <br>
You can play your part in safeguarding your personal information by not 
disclosing your login password or account information to anybody unless 
such person is duly authorised by you. Whenever you log in as a B-link 
Account user on B-link websites, particularly on somebody else's 
computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always log out at 
the end of your session. <br>
B-link cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third
 party accesses to your personal information as a result of your failure
 to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised 
use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of 
security. <br>
Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information. <br>
Retention Policy <br>
  <br>
Personal information will be held for as long as it is necessary to 
fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required or 
permitted by applicable laws. We shall cease to retain personal 
information, or remove the means by which the personal information can 
be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable 
to assume that the purpose for which that personal information was 
collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal 
information and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business 
purposes. <br>
You have control over your information! <br>
  <br>
Controlling settings <br>
B-link recognises that privacy concerns differ from person to person. 
Therefore, we provide examples of ways B-link makes available for you to
 choose to restrict the collection, use, disclosure or processing of 
your personal information and control your privacy settings: <br>

Log in and out of the B-link Account; <br>
Toggle on/off for the B-link Cloud sync functions <br>
You may obtain more details in relation to your device's security status in the B-link Security Centre as well. <br>
If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for 
the abovementioned purposes, you may change your mind at any time by 
writing or emailing us at info@lb-link.cn. <br>
Access, Updating or Correcting Your Personal Information <br>
You have the right to request access to and/or correction of any other 
personal information that we hold about you. When you update your 
personal information, you will be asked to verify your identity before 
we proceed with your request. Once we obtain sufficient information to 
accommodate your request for access to or correction of your personal 
information, we shall proceed to respond to your request within any 
timeframe set out under your applicable data protection laws. <br>
We normally provide such services for free but reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for your data access request. <br>
If you would like to request access to your personal data held by us or 
if you believe any information we are holding on you is incorrect or 
incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible at the email
 address below. Email: info@lb-link.cn. <br>

 request. www.lb-link.cn/index.php/other?id=303 ,click this link filled

Please recognise that your withdrawal of consent could result in certain
 legal consequences. Depending on the extent of your withdrawal of 
consent for us to process your personal information, it may mean that 
you will not be able to enjoy B-link's products and services. <br>
Transfer of personal information outside of your jurisdiction <br>
  <br>
To the extent that we may need to transfer personal information outside 
of your jurisdiction, whether to our affiliated companies (which are in 
the communications, social media, technology and cloud businesses) or 
Third Party Service Providers, we shall do so in accordance with the 
applicable laws. In particular, we will ensure that all transfers will 
be in accordance with requirements under your applicable local data 
protection laws by putting in place appropriate safeguards. <br>
B-link may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by B-link to 
process or back up your personal information. Currently, B-link has data
 centres in Beijing, United States and Singapore. These overseas 
jurisdictions may or may not have in place data protection laws which 
are substantially similar to that in your home jurisdiction. We may 
transfer to and store your personal information at our overseas 
facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to 
safeguard your personal information in accordance with this Privacy 
Policy. <br>
